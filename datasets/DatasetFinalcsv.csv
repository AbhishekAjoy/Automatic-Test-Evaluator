Ethyne is acidic in nature. Explain.,""Sodium reacts with ethyne displacing hydrogen and form sodium acetylide, The triply bonded carbon atoms of ethyne are sp hybridised. Since sp hybrid orbitals have 50% S-character and 50% P-C Character. Such carbon atom is more electronegative and electrons are held more strongly by the nucleus. So hydrogen attached to the triply boned C atom can be ionised more easily."",3,,
What is Wurtz reaction ?,Alkyl halides on treatment with sodium metal in dry ethereal (free from moisture) solution give higher alkanes. This reaction is known as Wurtz reaction and is used for the preparation of higher alkanes containing even number of carbon atoms.,3,,
What is mean by the greenhouse effect?,The phenomenon in which earth's atmosphere traps the heat from the sun and prevent it from re-radiating into the outer space is called Greenhouse Effect.,3,,
What is smog?,Smoke and fog together form smog.,3,,
What are the effects of photochemical smog?,""The compounds present in the smog cause irritation to eyes, nose and throat and cause respiratory problems like coughing, wheezing and bronchial asthma. O3 present in the smog reacts with materials made of rubber. PAN adversely affects green plants."",3,,
What are the major gases which contribute towards global warming?,""The gases like CO2, CH4, choroflurocarbons, water vapour etc."",3,,
What can we do to reduce global warming?,""Global warming can reduced by the following ways: Reduce the production and rare of greenhouse gases, Plant trees, Use eco-freindly fuels."",3,,
What are the major compounds responsible for acid rain?,""The acidic air pollutants like SO2, SO3, NO2 etc. When combined with atmosphere moisture form acid droplets. These droplets are washed down to the earth's surface by rain."",3,,
What are the harmful effects of acid rain?,""Acid rain destroys crops, aquatic lives and buildings. The acid rain will corrode building materials like marble, limestone etc. and dissolve heavy metals like Cu, Pb, Hg etc. in water and make it unfit for drinking. It fades the colour of the fabrics, leather and paper."",3,,
How do organic pollutants affect aquatic life?,""The organic compounds present in sew-age act as food for bacteria, viruses and protozoa which causes water borne diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice. Sewage produces foul odour and libepate. poisionous gases like H2S."",3,,
What is Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)?,BOD of a sample of water is defined as the amount of dissolved oxygen required for the oxidation of organic matter by aquatic micro-organisms under aerobic conditions at 241C for a period of 5 days.,3,,
Suggest two examples for non-viable particu- late pollutants.,""The important non-viable particulate pain-ants are mists, smoke, fumes, dust etc."",3,,
Write any two differences between classical smog and photochemical smog.,""Classical smog is formed in early morning hours of winter season due to the presence of carbon particles and gaseous oxides of sulphur present in the atmosphere. It has reducing character. Photochemical smog is formed in warm, dry and sunny climate due to the presence of ozone and oxides of nitrogen. It has oxidising character."",3,,
How the Green Chemistry is useful in bleaching of paper?,""Chlorine gas was used earlier for bleaching paper. Nowadays, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with suitable catalyst."",3,,
What do you mean by the term PCB?,Polychlorinated Biphenyls are called PCB.,3,,
How do chemical pollutants cause eutrophication?,The presence of fertilizers in polluted water increases the growth of algae and other aquatic plants which deplete the amount of dissolved oxygen in water. This is known as eutrophication.,3,,
Mention the adverse effects of high fluoride concentration in drinking water.,""High fluoride concentration in drinking water causes tooth decay, harmful effect to bones etc."",3,,
Suppose that your teacher asks you to conduct a seminar on ozone depletion. Give any three harmful effects of ozone depletion that you would present in the seminar.,""Ozone layer in the atmosphere protects us from the harmful UV radiation coming from the sun. Due to the formation of holes in the ozone umbrella more UV radiation reaches the earth which causes climate changes such as greenhouse effect. , UV radiations lead to ageing of skin, Cataract, Sunburn, Skin Cancer, Killing of many phytoplankton, damage to fish productivity, etc."",3,,
Carbon monoxide is one of the most serious air pollutants. How does it pollute the atmosphere?,""Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas and is produced as a result of incomplete combustion of carbon and fossil fuels. It combines with haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglobin which does not act as oxygen carrier. Depending upon concentration of CO in blood, it can cause mental impairment laboured respiration, muscular weakness, dizziness and even death."",3,,

The Taj Mahal in India has been affected by acid rain. Explain the causes and harmful effects of acid rain.,""When pH of the rain drops below 5, 6, it becomes acidic and is called acid rain. Acid rain is caused by the presence of oxides of Sulphur and Nitrogen and CO2, in the atmosphere. When these oxides become soluble in water, rain water becomes acidic and causes acid rain. Harmful effects of acid rain are: it is toxic to vegetation and aquatic life, it damages building, aquatic life and dissolves heavy metals from soils, rocks and semi-metals. Taj Mahal has been damaged by acid rain. The heavy metal ions such as Copper, lead, mercury and aluminium, leached from the soil."",3,,
What are the consequences of greenhouse effect?,""Due to Greenhouse effect, the average global temperature will increase. This will lead to the melting of polar ice caps and flooding of low lying areas all over the earth. Increase in the global temperature results in the infectious diseases like dengue, malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness etc."",3,,
